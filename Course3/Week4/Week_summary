Here I learned about P_values, Hypotheses, A/B testing, T_values and so on.
This helped me to understand what we are doing in machine learning and model analysis when we set the value 'alpha'
Honestly, before this course I just considered alpha as a paramater and didn't think about is deeply.
This course helped me to understand the terms in machine learning and model training in aspects of mathematics.
It was challenging, but worth learning. 

I'd like to thank Deep Learning AI for making this valuable course in Coursera.
