Here I learned about basic probability theories and additional machine learning labs
There were a lot of things too learn.
The assignment was about Naive Bayes formula.
The code included, shows that there are better formulas that shows high accuracy in detecting spam emails. 
This shows that the accuracy of machine learning models depend on what algorithm and what theory you implemented when building a model
